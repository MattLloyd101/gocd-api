gocd-api
=======

Module to access data from your Go CD server, e.g. to feed it into a build monitor.

Will give you access to both current activity (which stage is currently building, what is the state of the latest pipeline run) and history data about past pipeline runs.

In early stages, migrating from https://github.com/artwise/artwise
